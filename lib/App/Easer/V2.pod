=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<NOTE>: THIS DOCUMENT HAS TO BE REVIEWED TO MAKE IT EXPLICIT THAT IT
REFERS TO VERSION 2 OF THE API.

App::Easer::V2 provides the scaffolding for implementing hierarchical
command-line applications in a very fast way. This is Version 2 of the
provided API, which does everything described below.

It makes it extremely simple to generate an application based on
specific interfacing options, while still leaving ample capabilities for
customising the shape of the application. As such, it aims at making
simple things easy and complex things possible, in pure Perl spirit.

There are multiple ways to define an application. The two extremes are:

=over

=item *

a hash reference with all the needed elements inside (see L</SYNOPSIS>
for an example)

=item *

a sub-class of C<App::Easer::V2::Command> with methods overriding the
needed elements where the programmer sees fit.

=back

App::Easer::V2 allows also to leverage both aspects at the same time for
the same command, e.g. setting some parts through a hash reference and
other parts with overriding methods.

=head2 Top-Level Functions

The following functions are exported by C<App::Easer::V2>:

=over

=item * C<appeaser_api>

   my $api_version = appeaser_api();

Return string C<V2>.

=item * C<d>

   d($whatever);

Sends C<$whatever> through C<dd> and then to C<warn>.

=item * C<dd>

   my $dumped = dd($whatever);

Sends C<$whatever> through L<Data::Dumper> and returns it.

=item * C<run>

   my $exit_code = run($cmd_hashref, $0, @ARGV);

Run a command with the provided parameters (first the name of the
command, using C<$0>, then the command-line arguments).

=back

In addition to importing the functions above, the following keys are
also supported when C<use>ing the module:

=over

=item * C<-command>

The package from where C<App::Easer::V2> is C<use>d is a command and
inherits from C<App::Easer::V2::Command>, as well as registering as a
command. This is the combined effect of C<-inherit> and C<-register>
below.

=item * C<-inherit>

The package from where C<App::Easer::V2> is C<use>d inherits from
C<App::Easer::V2::Command>. Usually C<-command> is the right one though.

=item * C<-register>

Register this package as a valid (sub)command.

=item * C<-spec>

Provide a specification hash reference to set many attributes of the
specific command. This hash reference is saved into the package's
variable C<app_easer_spec>.

=back

The options above allow easily define a new class for a command like
this:

   use App::Easer::V2 -command => -spec => { ... };


=head2 Anatomy of a run

Running an application can be done in several ways, depending on how the
application is represented:

   # application defined as a hashref or arrayref
   use App::Easer V2 => 'run';
   exit run($app, $0, @ARGS);

   # application defined in a class
   use MyApp;
   exit MyApp->new->run($0, @ARGS);

When an application is run, the following high level algorithm is
applied:

=over

=item *

Options are gathered from different I<sources>, like e.g. the
command-line, environment variables, parent commands (in lower levels of
the command hierarchy), files, or defaults.

=item *

A I<commit> hook is called, if present, allowing an intermediate command
to perform some actions before a sub-command is run. This hook has been
anticipated I<before> validation in V2.

=item *

A I<validation> hook is called, if present, allowing check of the
provided configuration, e.g. to spot incompatible options.

=item *

A sub-command is searched if possible and, if present, the process
restarts from the first bullet above with this sub-command.

=item *

When the final sub-command is reached, the I<execute> hook is run.

=back


=head2 Application High Level View

The following list provides all keys/method names that are recognized in
the definition of an application with C<App::Easer::V2>. Items markes as
C<Executable> can be provided as sub references or with overriding the
corresponding method in the derived class.

=over

=item C<aliases>

Array of strings.

The array contains alias names for the command. The first alias is also
considered the C<name> in case a C<name> is missing.

=item C<allow_residual_options>

Boolean, defaults to I<false>.

Signal that the parsing of the command line must not fail if residual,
unrecognized options are found. This allows e.g. building wrappers
around external commands without the need to re-implement all of their
options.

=item C<auto_environment>

Boolean, defaults to I<false>.

Signal that all options without an C<environment> key should get one set
to value 1, triggering auto-generation of the environment variable name.

=item C<children>

Array of items.

Provides a list of children for the command. Children can be provided as
hash references (whose structure is the same as anytyhing supported by
C<hashy_class>), array references (whose first item is the name of a
class and the rest is provided to its C<new> method), a string (which
leads to a class name that can be instantiated without parameters), or a
blessed object.

Anything that does not eventually produce a C<App::Easer::V2::Command>
should be considered a liability.

=item C<children_prefixes>

Array of strings. Defaults to C<[$pkg . '::Cmd']>.

Each string in the array is used as a prefix to look for sub-commands in
C<@INC>.

Assuming the main command is implemented in class C<MyApp>, the default
value looks for classes named C<MyApp::Cmd*>, e.g. C<MyApp::CmdFoo> and
C<MyApp::CmdBar> and I<ignores> classed named C<MyApp::Common> or
C<MyApp::Utils>.

=item C<commit>

Executable with signature:

   sub commit_function ($app) { ... }

where C<$app> is the blessed object for the application.

Perform the I<commit> hook for the application, which is called
immediately after the I<collection> of options for the command and
before looking further down for sub-commands or calling the C<execute>
method. Every weird action like fiddling with the command-line arguments
etc. should be done here.

=item C<default_child>

String. Defaults to C<help>.

The name of a sub-command to invoke if no non-option values are set on
the command line for a non-leaf command.

If set to C<-self>, lack of an explicit child name on the command line
means that the C<execute> of the command itself should be run.

See also C<fallback_to>.

=item C<description>

String.

A verbose form of C<help>, usually providing details about how the
command works. This is used when generating the whole help for the
command.

=item C<environment_prefix>

String.

A prefix that is applied to an options's name to derive an environment
variable name. Used when C<auto_environment> is true and no
C<environment> key is present in the option's specification, or when the
C<environment> key points to value C<1>.

=item C<execute>

Executable.

=item C<fallback_to>

String.

The name of a sub-command to invoke if the first non-option command-line
argument is not recognized as a children command for non-leaf commands.

If set to C<-self>, lack of a valid child name on the command line means
that the C<execute> of the command itself should be run.

If set to C<-default>, the C<default_child> is used.

If set to a non-negative integer I<n>, the I<n-th> child is used from
the list of children.

If set to a string, the corresponding child is used.

Otherwise, an exception is raised.

See also C<default_child>.

=item C<force_auto_children>

Boolean. Defaults to I<false>.

Force the generation of the so-called I<auto>-children even for leaf
commands (i.e. commands without sub-commands either in C<children> or
from the class hierarchy).

Auto-children are the C<help>, C<commands>, and C<tree> sub-commands.

This can come handy when C<default_child>/C<fallback_to> are set to
C<-self> and the three words C<help>, C<commands>, and C<tree> are not
possible valid values as arguments for the leaf command itself (e.g.
when it does not use non-option command line arguments).

=item C<getopt_config>

Array of strings. See below for defaults.

A list of strings to use to configure C<Getopt::Long> for the specific
command.

By default it is set to C<gnu_getopt>. If a command is I<not> a leaf,
C<require_order> and C<pass_through> are added too, although the latter
only temporarily to allow for chaining (unrecognized options might still
trigger an exception). If C<allow_residual_options> is true,
C<pass_through> is added.

=item C<hashy_class>

String. Defaults to C<App::Easer::V2::Command>.

The class name to use for inflating applications defined as hash
references into objects.

Anything different from the default is a liability.

=item C<help>

A concise form of help, ideally a single line to explain what the
(sub-)command does. It is used when generating the whole help for the
command, as well as the list of sub-commands of the help for the parent
command.

=item C<help_channel>

String. Defaults to C<-STDOUT:encoding(UTF-8)>.

Set the output channel for automatic commands C<help>, C<commands>, and
C<tree>.

It can be set to:

=over

=item *

a sub reference, which will be called with the following signature:

   sub channel ($cmd_object, @stuff_to_print);

=item *

a filehandle, used to print out stuff

=item *

a reference to a scalar, where the output will be placed

=item *

a string of the form C<filename[:binmode]>, where C<filename> can B<NOT>
contain the character C<:>. The file will be opened and if the
C<binmode> part is provided, C<binmode()> will be called on the
resulting filehandle with the provided value.

If the C<filename> part is C<-> or C<-stdout> (case insensitive), then
C<STDOUT> will be used. If C<filename> is C<-stderr> (case insensitive),
then C<STDERR> will be used.

=back

=item C<name>

String.

Name of the command. If absent, the first item in the C<alias> array is
used.

=item C<options>

Array of items.

See L</OPTIONS>.

=item C<params_validate>

Hash reference or C<undef>. Ignored if L</validate> is set.

If passed as a hash reference, two keys are supported:

=over

=item C<args>

call C<Params::Validate::validate_pos> on the C<residual_args> (see
L</OPTIONS>).

=item C<config>

call C<Params::Validate::validate> on the collected I<merged>
configuration (see L</OPTIONS>).

=back

=item C<sources>

Array of items.

See L</OPTIONS>.

=item C<validate>

Sub reference for performing validation. Will be called during the
validation phase and passed the command object instance:

   $validation_sub->($self);

If set, L</params_validate> is ignored.

=back

The following YAML representation gives an overview of the elements that
define an application managed by C<App::Easer::V2>, highlighting the
necessary or I<strongly suggested> ones at the beginning:

  aliases: «array of strings»
  execute: «executable»
  help: «string»
  options: «array of hashes»

  allow_residual_options: «boolean»
  auto_environment: «boolean»
  children: «array of hashes»
  children_prefixes: «array of strings»
  commit: «executable»
  default_child: «string»
  description: «string»
  environment_prefix: «string»
  fallback_to: «string»
  force_auto_children: «boolean»
  hashy_class: «string»
  help_channel: «string»
  name: «string»
  params_validate: «hash»
  sources: «array of items»
  validate: «executable»

As anticipated, it's entirely up to the user to decide what style is
best, i.e. define applications through metadata only, through
object-oriented derivation, or through a mix of the two. The following
examples are aimed at producing the same application:

   # metadata (mostly)
   my $app_as_metadata = {
      aliases => [qw< this that >],
      help => 'this is the application, but also that',
      options => [ { getopt => 'foo|f=s', default => 'bar' } ],
      execute => sub ($app) {
         say 'foo is ', $app->config('foo');
         return 0;
      },
   };

   # class only
   package ThisThatApp;
   use App::Easer::V2 '-command';
   sub aliases ($self) { return [qw< this that >] }
   sub help ($self) { return 'this is the application, but also that' }
   sub options ($self) { [ { getopt => 'foo|f=s', default => 'bar' } ] }
   sub execute ($self) {
      say 'foo is ', $self->config('foo');
      return 0;
   }

   # mixed style
   package ThisThatMixedApp;
   use App::Easer::V2 -command => -spec => {
      aliases => [qw< this that >],
      help => 'this is the application, but also that',
      options => [ { getopt => 'foo|f=s', default => 'bar' } ],
   };
   sub execute ($self) {
      say 'foo is ', $self->config('foo');
      return 0;
   }

The last style allows keeping data mostly as data, while leaving the
freedom to implement the logic as proper methods, which can be
beneficial for e.g. sharing common logic among several commands.

=head1 App::Easer::V2::Command METHODS

When a command is created, it is (usually) an instance of class
C<App::Easer::V2::Command> or a descendant. As such, it has the
methods explained in the following list, which at the moment appear as
public ones although some might be hidden in the future (stable ones are
expressely marked so).

=over

=item C<auto_children>

   my @classes = $self->auto_children;
   my @objects = $self->auto_children(1);

Return a list of the automatic children (C<help>, C<commands>, and
C<tree>) as inflatable children, i.e. as fully qualified class names. If
an optional true value is passed, children are inflated into objects.

=item C<auto_commands>

   my $instance = $self->auto_commands;

Returns an instance representing the C<commands> sub-command.

=item C<auto_help>

   my $instance = $self->auto_help;

Returns an instance representing the C<help> sub-command.

=item C<auto_tree>

   my $instance = $self->auto_tree;

Returns an instance representing the C<tree> sub-command.

=item C<aliases>

   my @aliases = $self->aliases;
   my @modified = $self->aliases(\@new_aliases);

Gets/sets the aliases. If not set, C<name> is used.

See L</Application High Level View>.

=item C<allow_residual_options>

   my $boolean = $self->allow_residual_options;
   $self->allow_residual_options(0); # disable
   $self->allow_residual_options(1); # enable

See L</Application High Level View>.

=item C<auto_environment>

   my $boolean = $self->auto_environment;
   $self->auto_environment(0); # disable
   $self->auto_environment(1); # enable

See L</Application High Level View>.

=item C<call_name>

   my $string = $self->call_name;
   $self->call_name('override, for no reason apparently...');

Returns a string with the name used to call the sub command (useful to
figure out which of the C<aliases> was used).

The method can also be used to I<set> this name, if needed. This is not
guaranteed to be future-proof.

=item C<children>

   my @direct_children = $self->children;
   $self->children(\@new_direct_children);

Get/set the list of I<direct> children. Other children might be
collected automatically from the class hierarchy.

Use of this method is discouraged and not future-proof.

See L</Application High Level View>.

=item C<children_prefixes>

   my $aref = $self->children_prefixes;
   $self->children_prefixes(\@new_prefixes);

See L</Application High Level View>.

=item C<collect>

   $self->collect;

Collect options values from the configured sources, see L</OPTIONS>.

Not assumed to be used directly. Overloading is a liability.

=item C<commit>

   $self->commit;

Commit the collected options.

Not assumed to be used directly.

It can be overloaded to provide a custom behaviour, which can e.g.
modify C<residual_args> or C<config_hash> to drive following steps of
looking for a sub-command.

=item C<config>

   my $value = $self->config($key);   # returns a scalar anyway
   my @values = $self->config(@keys);

Retrieve collected option values.

=item C<config_hash>

   my $merged_hash = $self->config_hash;
   my $detailed    = $self->config_hash(1);

Get the collected option values as a hash.

In the basic case, a I<merged> hash is returned, with values taken from
sources according to their priorities.

In the advanced case where a I<true> value is passed as optional
argument, a hash with two keys C<merged> and C<sequence> is returned.
The explanation of the data format is beyond the scope of this manual
page.

=item C<default_child>

   my $dc = $self->default_child;
   $self->default_child($new_name);

See L</Application High Level View>.

=item C<description>

   my $text = $self->description;
   $self->description($updated_description);

See L</Application High Level View>.

=item C<environment_prefix>

   my $prefix = $self->environment_prefix;
   $self->environment_prefix($new_prefix);

See L</Application High Level View>.

=item C<environment_variable_name>

   my $name = $self->environment_variable_name($opt_hash);

Get the environment variable name set for the specific option described
by C<$opt_hash>. If it contains an C<environment> key and it has a name,
that is returned, otherwise if it is C<1> then an environment variable
is generated from C<envoronment_prefix> and C<name>.

=item C<execute>

   $self->execute;

Code that executes the main logic of the command.

If a sub reference was provided with C<execute> in the application
definition, that is called receiving the object as its only parameter.
Otherwise, the intended use is to override this method in a derived
class for a command.

It is not meant to be called directly.

=item C<execution_reason>

   my $reason = $self->execution_reason;

A string representing the reason why the specific C<execute>
method/callback was selected, can be one of:

=over

=item * C<-default>

The command was selected as the default child set for a command.

=item * C<-fallback>

The command was selected as a result of the C<fallback> method.

=item * C<-leaf>

The command is a leaf and has no sub-commands.

=back

=item C<fallback>

   my $name = $self->fallback;

Select a fallback child, or the invoking command itself (returning
C<-self>) as the command that should be investigated next or executed.

This method is called when there are unrecognized non-option
command-line arguments that lead to no child of a non-leaf command. The
selection is performed using C<fallback_to>.

=item C<fallback_to>

   my $name = $self->fallback_to;
   $self->fallback_to($new_fallback);

Get/set the fallback string for figuring out the fallback in case of
need. Used by C<fallback>.

See L</Application High Level View>.

=item C<final_collect>

   $self->final_collect($callback_sub);
   $self->final_collect;

Can be set either as a callback or as a method override. Not supposed to
be called directly.

See L<< /Sources as hash reference >>. Available after version
C<2.007001> (not included).

=item C<final_commit>

   $self->final_commit($callback_sub);
   $self->final_commit;

Can be set either as a callback or as a method override. Not supposed to
be called directly.

See L<< /New commit finalization: C<final_commit> >>. Available after
version C<2.007001> (not included).

=item C<final_commit_stack>

   my @sequence = $self->final_commit_stack;

Sequence of command objects during the C<final_commit> phase.

See L<< /New commit finalization: C<final_commit> >>. Available after
version C<2.007001> (not included).

=item C<find_child>

   my ($child_instance, @child_args) = $self->find_child;

Look for a child to hand execution over. Returns an child instance or
undef (which means that the C<$self> is in charge of executing
something). This implements the most sensible default, deviations will
have to be coded explicitly.

This method is called by C<run> and is not expected to be called
elsewhere. It use is discouraged and not future-proof.

Returns a list with the selected children and the arguments to feed to
its C<run> method:

=over

=item *

   (undef, '-leaf')

if no child exists. In this case, the caller command's C<execute> method
should be used.

=item *

   ($instance, @args)

if a child is found in C<$args[0]>.

=item *

   ($instance, '-default')

if the default child is returned.

=item *

   (undef, '-fallback')

in case $self is the fallback and should be used for calling the
C<execute> method.

=item *

   ($instance, '-fallback', @args)

in case the fallback is returned, with the residual unparsed arguments.

=back

=item C<find_matching_child>

   my $instance = $self->find_matching_child($name);

Find and instantiate a child matching C<$name>, either directly or as an
alias.

=item C<force_auto_children>

   my $boolean = $self->force_auto_children;
   $self->force_auto_children(0); # disable
   $self->force_auto_children(1); # enable

See L</Application High Level View>.

=item C<full_help_text>

   my $full_help = $self->full_help_text;
   my $usage_help = $self->full_help_text('usage');

Get the full auto-generated help text for the command, e.g. to print it.

It can be passed an additional string paramter, which can be C<help> or
C<usage>. The former generates the help including the C<Description>
section, the latter does not include it.

=item C<getopt_config>

   my $aref = $self->getopt_config;
   $self->getopt_config(\@custom_getopt_long_configuration);

See L</Application High Level View>.

=item C<hashy_class>

   my $class = $self->hashy_class;
   $self->hashy_class($new_class);

Setting this to anything different from C<App::Easer::V2::Command> is a
liability, although it might make sense to set to a derived class to
provide a common set of methods useful for the specific application.

See L</Application High Level View>.

=item C<help>

   my $text = $self->help;
   $self->help($new_help_line);

See L</Application High Level View>.

=item C<help_channel>

   my $ch = $self->help_channel;
   $self->help_channel($new_channel);

See L</Application High Level View>.

=item C<inflate_children>

   my @instances = $self->inflate_children(@hints);

Turn a list of C<@hints> into corresponding instances.

A blessed hint is always returned unmodified, assuming it's already a
valid instance. No check on the class is performed.

A hash reference is inflated using C<hashy_class>.

An array reference assumes that the first element in the array is a
valid C<hashy_class> and the rest of the items are passed to its C<new>
method.

Anything else is considered a string containing a class to instantiate.

Actual instantiation is done using method C<instantiate>.

Direct use of this method is a liability.

=item C<inherit_options>

   my @options = $self->inherit_options(@options_names);

Look for matching names in a parent's options. This does technically
I<not> put these options inside the command, but it is used internally
to achieve this goal.

This method is not meant to be called directly and is subject to become
a private method, so its usage is discouraged and not future-proof.

=item C<instantiate>

   my $instance = $self_or_package->instantiate($class, @args);

This method loads class C<$class> via C<load_module> and returns:

   $class->new(@args);

This is a class method.

=item C<is_root>

   say 'root command!' if $self->is_root;

Return I<true> if the command is the I<root>, i.e. if it has no parent.
Available after version C<2.007001>.

=item C<list_children>

   my @children = $self->list_children;

Return the I<full> list of children for a command, including ones
gathered in the class tree and auto-generated ones (these are added only
if there are other children or if C<force_auto_children> is set to a
I<true> value).

=item C<load_module>

   my $module_name_copy = $self->load_module($module_name);

Load C<$module_name> with C<require> and return the name itself. The
module name can only be provided using C<::> as separators. No specific
bug from the past of Perl is addressed.

=item C<merge_hashes>

   my $merged = $self->merge_hashes(@inputs);

Takes a list of input hash references and generates a merged version of
all of them. Hashes in C<@inputs> are supposed to be provided in
priority order, where those coming first take precedence over those
coming next.

=item C<name>

   my $name = $self->name;
   $self->name($new_name);

Get/set name of command. If not present, the first item of C<aliases> is
used. If this is not set too, or empty, string C<** no name **> is used.

See L</Application High Level View>.

=item C<name_for_option>

   my $opt_name = $self->name_for_option($opt_spec_hashref);

Get the option's name, either from its C<name> key, or deriving it from
C<getopt>, or from C<environment>. Returns C<~~~> if none of them works.

=item C<new>

   my $instance = $class->new(@spec);
   my $other    = $class->new(\%spec);

Instantiate a new object, using the provided values.

In derived classes, additional specifications are also taken from the
package variable C<$class . '::app_easer_spec'>, if set.

=item C<options>

   my @options_aoh = $self->options;
   $self->options(\@new_options);

See L</Application High Level View> and L</OPTIONS>. The returned list
if passed through C<resolve_options> anyway, e.g. to inherit options.

=item C<options_help>

   my $options_help = $self->options_help;
   $self->options_help($new_help);

Set text to be printed for the options.

If set to a plain string, that string is all that will be printed, i.e.
no automatic help text from C<options> will be generated.

If set to a hash reference, two keys are supported: C<preamble> and
C<postamble>. When present, they will be printed respectively before and
after the help text generated automatically from C<options>.

=item C<params_validate>

   my $href_or_undef = $self->params_validate;
   $self->params_validate($new_pv_conf);

See L</Application High Level View>.

=item C<parent>

   my $parent_command = $self->parent;

Get the parent command.

=item C<ref_to_sub>

   my $sub = $self->ref_to_sub($locator);

Turn a I<locator> for a sub into a proper reference to a sub. The
C<$locator> can be:

=over

=item *

a sub reference, that is returned unmodified;

=item *

an array reference with two items inside, i.e. a class/module name
followed by a method/function name

=item *

a string pointing to the function, either fully qualified as in
C<My::Class::function> or as a plain name that will be looked for in the
class of C<$self>.

=back

=item C<residual_args>

   my @residual_args = $self->residual_args;
   $self->residual_args(\@new_args);

Access the list of I<residual> (i.e. unparsed) arguments from the
command line.

=item C<resolve_options>

   my @options = $self->resolve_options($single_specification);

Expand a C<$single_specification> into one or more options. Basic
optiosn specifications are hash references, but they might be strings
like C<+parent> (for inheriting all that is I<transmitted> from a parent
command) or regular expressions to bulk import options based on their
names.

=item C<root>

   my $root_command = $self->root;

Generalization of L</parent> to go all the way up to the topmost command
of the chain. Available after version C<2.007001>.

=item C<run>

   $self->run($command_name, @arguments);

Run a command. The first parameter is the command name, it should
probably be set to C<$0> when calling the topmost command.

Running means parsing all options and potentially looking for
sub-commands, until one is found.

Returns whatever the C<execute> method of the selected sub-command
returns.

=item C<run_help>

   $self->run_help;
   $self->run_help('usage');

Run the C<auto_help> command, which should print out the help for the
command itself. This is not usually needed, but comes handy to implement
printing the help not via a sub-command but honoring a command-line
option, like this:

   sub execute ($self) {
      return $self->run_help if $self->config('help');
      ...
   }

It is possible to pass the string C<help> (default) or the string
C<usage>; the latter prints a shorter message, i.e. it does not print
the C<Description> section.

=item C<set_config>

   $self->set_config(foo => 'bar');

Set a new value for a configuration, overriding what has been found out
from the several input sources.

=item C<slot>

   my $hashref = $self->slot;
   $self->slot($new_data);

C<App::Easer::V2> uses a blessed hash reference to manage all data
related to an object representing a command. To minimize overlapping
with a user's object data, all data for C<App::Easer::V2> is kept in a
sub-hash pointed by the C<slot> key, like this:

   bless {
      $class_name => {
         ... all actual App::Easer::V2 stuff here ...
      }
   }, $hashy_class;

This method gives access to this slot and can be overridden to keep this
data elsewhere, e.g. in an array element or in an inside-out object,
without the need to re-implement all accessors.

=item C<slurp>

   my $contents   = $self->slurp($filename);
   my $contents_2 = $self->slurp($filename, '<:raw');

Get the whole contents from a file, optionally specifying the mode for
openining the file. By default, UTF-8 encoding is assumed and enforced.

Use of this method is discouraged and not future-proof.

=item C<sources>

   my @sources = $self->sources;
   $self->sources(\@new_sources_list);

See L</Application High Level View> and L</OPTIONS>.

=item C<validate>

   $self->validate(\&validation_sub);
   $self->validate;

Performs validation.

When a validation sub is set (either calling with a parameter, or
setting it via C<validate> in L</new>) it will be called, receiving
C<$self> as the only parameter:

   $sub->($self);

The validator is supposed to throw an exception upon validation failure.

If no validation sub is set, L</params_validate> is looked for. If
present, validation is applied according to it, using
L<Params::Validate>.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

The main capability provided by C<App::Easer> is the flexibility to
handle options, collecting them from several sources and merging them
together according to priorities.

Supported options are set in an array of hashes (or strings) pointed by
the C<options> key. Each hash in the array sets the details regarding a
single option.  When provided as string, the option is I<inherited> from
a parent, allowing the sub-command to expose the same option as the
parent. This gives freedom to put options and values either in the
parent or in the descendant command, providing flexibility.

This is a YAML overview of how to set one option as a hash:

   name: «string»
   help: «string»
   transmit: «boolean»
   transmit_exact: «boolean»
   getopt: «string»
   environment: «string» or 1
   default: any value

A few keys inside the hash regard the option itself, like:

=over

=item * C<name>

name of the option. This is not mandatory if C<getopt> is present, which
gets the name automatically from the first alias of the option itself;

=item * C<help>

some help about the option.

=item * C<transmit>

boolean to set whether an option can be easily "inherited" by a
sub-command (without the need to put all attributes of the option once
again).

=item * C<transmit_exact>

boolean to set whether the option must be spelled exactly to be
inherited (no inheritance via a regular expression).

=back

=head2 Option Values Collection

The collection is performed thanks to I<sources>, which can be set with
the corresponding C<sources> key or method (depending on the style).
C<App::Easer> comes with several sources for getting configurations from
a variety of places, but still leaves the door open to add more
customized ones.

Up to version C<2.007001> included, the C<sources> key could only point
to an I<array reference> holding a list of sources. After that release,
it has been expanded to I<also> accept a I<hash reference>, allowing for
a new and more sophisticated handling of option values collection. In
either case, anyway, processing arrives at a point where there is a
I<list of sources> to be processed as described below; using the I<array
ref> keeps backwards compatibility with the old behaviour. See
L</Sources as hash reference> for additional details on the new way.

Sources are I<considered> with respect to two different ordering
methods: their place in the array pointed by key C<sources> and their
I<priority>. The former sets the order in which data from each source is
collected, the latter sets the precedence while assembling conflicting
data from several different sources (lower priorities means higher
precedence).

Each source can be set either as a C<$locator> (see ahead) or as an
array reference with the following structure:

   [ $locator, @args ]

The C<$locator> can be a reference to a sub, which is used as the source
itself, or a string that allows getting the source sub to handle the
specific source. Strings starting with the C<+> character are reserved
for sources provided by C<App::Easer::V2> natively.

If C<$locator> is a plain string, it is possible to set the I<priority>
directly inside it with C<=NN> (e.g. C<+Default=100>).  It's not
necessary to set the priority; if missing, it will be assumed to be 10
more than the previous one in the array (with the first item starting at
10). This also means that, by default, the ordering of sources also
doubles down as the ordering of precedence.

The C<@args> part can provide additional arguments to the specific
source; its applicability is dependent on the source itself. As the only
exception, if the I<first> item of C<@args> is a hash reference, it will
be removed from the array and used to gather additional I<meta-options>
used directly by C<App::Easer>. At the moment, this is an alternative
way to set the priority of the specific source using the key
C<priority>. This means that the following examples are equivalent:

   # priority in source name, like anywhere else
   [ '+FromTrail=90', qw< defaults foo baz > ],

   # priority in meta-options first-arguments hash reference
   [ '+FromTrail', {priority => 90}, qw< defaults foo baz > ],

After the C<$locator> has been resolved to a sub reference
C<$located_sub>, and the first item in C<@args> has been analyzed and
possibly removed (because it contains I<meta-options> as described
above), the sub reference is invoked like follows:

   $located_sub->($command, $args_arrayref, $inputs_arrayref);

where:

=over

=item *

C<$command> is the instance of the (sub-)command under analysis

=item *

C<$args_arrayref> is a reference to an array containing the remaining
arguments provided via C<@args> in the source definition (when the array
reference format C<[ $locator @args ]> form has been used). This array
reference does I<not> contain the I<meta-options>.

=item *

C<$inputs_arrayref> is a reference to an array holding the input
command-line parameters (at least what's left of them after processing
by previous sources).

=back

Unless the source is supposed to process command-line arguments, it
should just ignore the third parameter and focus on the first two.

It's not necessary to set the C<sources> explicitly, as by default the
following configuration is assumed:

   +CmdLine +Environment +Parent=70 +Default=100

where the respective priorities are, in order, 10, 20, 70, and 100.

Sources provided out of the box by C<App::Easer::V2> are:

=over

=item * C<+CmdLine>

This source gathers options from the command line arguments. It is set
using the C<getopt> key, according to the rules explained in
C<GetOpt::Long>. The first alias of an option is also set as the
option's name in case key C<name> is missing.

=item * C<+LastCmdLine>

(After version C<2.007001>, excluded)

This source returns the same configuration hash as that determined by
the last C<+CmdLine> that was executed within a specific command level.

This source is supposed to be used only in relation to the new
I<hash-based> way of setting sources (see L</Sources as hash
reference>).

=item * C<+Environment>

This source gets values from environment variables. It is set using the
C<environment> key, which can be set to either the name of the
environment variable (this is case sensitive) or automatically from
higher-level configuration C<environment_prefix> and the option's name
in case it is set to value C<1> exactly.

This source expliticly ignores I<inherited> options, to prevent
overwriting previously set options. It is possible to override this:

   [ '+Environment', include_inherited => 1 ]

Another alternative to do this is use C<+FinalEnvironment>.

=item * C<+FinalEnvironment>

This source works the same as C<+Environment>, except that it works also
for options that have been inherited. This is particularly useful when
using L<Sources as hash reference>.

=item * C<+Parent>

This source gets values from a parent command (it only applies to
sub-commands).

=item * C<+Default>

Get a default value from the C<default> sub-key of the option.

This source expliticly ignores I<inherited> options, to prevent
overwriting previously set options. It is possible to override this:

   [ '+Default', include_inherited => 1 ]

Another alternative to do this is use C<+FinalDefault>.

=item * C<+FinalDefault>

This source works the same as C<+Default>, except that it works also for
options that have been inherited. This is particularly useful when using
L<Sources as hash reference>.

=item * C<+JsonFileFromConfig>

Get keys/values from a JSON file, whose path is pointed by a key in the
collected options. By default this key is C<config>. To set a different
key, pass this source as an array reference with the source name and the
key, like this:

   [ JsonFileFromConfig => 'jcnf' ]

=item * C<+JsonFiles>

Get keys/values from a few JSON files (it's OK if they do not exist). To
set the files to try, pass this source as an array reference:

   [ JsonFiles => @paths ]

=item * C<+FromTrail>

Get keys/values from a sub-hash of the already collected options (e.g.
after loading them from a configuration file). The I<trail> to the
position of the sub-hash is provided like this:

   [ FromTrail => qw< topcmd subcmd additional_values > ]

=back

It is possible to set a I<default> value for the option used by
C<JsonFileFromConfig>, as long as the C<+Default> source is placed
before C<JsonFileFromConfig>. In this case, it's usually necessary to
assign a lower priority value to C<JsonFileFromConfig> to make sure
values read from there take precedence over the defaults:

   sources => [qw<
      +CmdLine=10 +Environment=20 +Parent=30 +Default=100
      +JsonFileFromConfig=40
   >];

This is the main reason why the I<priority> has been detached from order
of appearance.

=head3 Sources as hash reference

Up to version C<2.007001>, the C<sources> key can only be set to an
array reference holding a list of sources. Each command level can have
its own list, or rely on the default one provided by C<App::Easer>.

This setup works in many situation but becomes too rigid when dealing
with inherited options. As an example, suppose that we define an option
C<loglevel> allowing to set the log level (e.g. info, debug, trace, ...)
for our suite of commands. At this point, either we limit the option at
the highest level only (then setting the logger configuration in the
topmost command's C<commit>), or we have to wait until the leaf command
is determined, which implies that every leaf command must repeat the
code to set the logger's configuration.

Additionally, this setup might not play well with options that load
configurations from files, because some files might be loaded based on
command line configurations that appear in upper commands but might
eventually be overridden in lower commands. So, in the following
example, we want to be able to only load C<second.json> and disregard
C<first.json>:

   myprg --config first.json foo --config second.json

For this reason, release past C<2.007001> (which is not included) also
support an alternative way of configuring C<sources>, namely through a
hash reference that supports three keys:


=over

=item C<current>

(mandatory) this is the equivalent of the I<old> behaviour, i.e. a list
of sources that is used to figure out the order and precedence of
collecting options.

=item C<next>

(optional) this allows setting the list of sources for the children
sub-commands (unless the sub-command has one already configured), i.e.
its C<current> when it will be called. It can be a straight list or a
sub reference, in which case it will be called to determine the list.

When absent, by default the children inherits the same C<current> list
as the parent command.

=item C<final>

(optional) this allows setting a list of sources that is used at the
very end of the child determination process, i.e. when the program
determines the descendant sub-command for which the C<execute>
method/callback will be called, in a new sub-phase aptly named
C<final_collect>.

=back

With the new hash-based configuration, the determination of the right
sub-command proceeds like before, using the C<current> list of sources
at each step (the C<current> for a sub-command might have been set using
the C<next> of the parent command). During this phase, the C<commit>
method/callback is called at every level just like before.

After the search for the right command to C<execute> is finished, method
C<final_collect> is called, using the C<final> list of the hash
reference. This allows deferring the collection of data from
non-commmand-line sources at the very end.

The default configuration when adopting the new hash-based C<sources> is
the following:

   {
      current => [ qw< +CmdLine +Parent > ],
      final =>
         [ qw< +LastCmdLine +Parent +FinalEnvironment +FinalDefault > ],
   }

In this configuration, all command levels share the same I<forward>
configuration, only gathering command-line parameters, with later
sub-commands taking precedence (C<+CmdLine> has higher priority than
C<+Parent>).

After the right sub-command to execute is determined, then the latest
command line is taken (it is not parsed again), then the parent (like
before, it only contains command-line parameters from upper commands),
then the environment, then the defaults.

In summary: all command-line parameters with precedence from right to
left, then the environment, then defaults.

It is easy to also add the C<+JsonFileFromConfig> source, like in the
following example:


   {
      current => [ qw< +CmdLine +Parent > ],
      final =>
         [
            qw<
               +LastCmdLine=10
               +Parent=20
               +FinalEnvironment=30
               +FinalDefault=100
               +JsonFileFromConfig=40
            >
         ],
   }

Priorities for the first three sources in C<final> are set explicitly
but would take the same values implicitly, they have been put in the
example only for clarity.

As before, we put the C<+FinalDefault> option I<before> the
C<+JsonFileFromConfig> so that we can read the default value for the
C<config> option (if present), while still giving stuff from the file
precendence over the defaults.

After this information gathering phase, method/callback C<final_commit>
is called (much like C<commit> is called after C<collect>).

It is possible to set key C<final_collect> or override it as a method,
for maximum flexibility. Doing this is a liability.


=head3 New commit finalization: C<final_commit>

in the new L</Sources as hash reference> way of setting C<sources>,
after the final roundup of options done by C<final_collect>, the
C<final_commit> method/callback is executed.

By default, this triggers calling it all up the commands ladder, i.e.
from the leaf command that will be executed up to the root command. This
allows setting "final configurations" (like a logger) in the
C<final_commit> method of the topmost command, once and for all.

It is anyway possible to set callbacks or override the method at each
intermediate or at the leaf level, of course. In this case, the return
value of the method/callback will be used to determine whether to
continue up the ladder or not; I<true> values will continue the call
chain, I<false> values will interrupt it.

It's also possible to break the chain of calls by setting the key to a
I<false> value.

It MUST be considered that the method is specific to each command, which
usually does not have an I<updated> view of the whole configuration,
because that is only known to the leaf command's object. For this
reason, method/callback C<final_commit> can also call method
C<final_commit_stack>, which provides a list of all command objects that
are involved in the chain, starting from the leaf command down towards
the root.

For this reason, the way to get the I<full> configuration in the topmost
command is the following:

   sub final_commit ($self) {
      my ($leaf) = $self->final_commit_stack;
      my $final_config = $leaf->config_hash;
      ...
   }

Method C<final_commit_stack> is only available (predictably) inside
method/callback C<final_commit>; its availability elsewhere is not
guaranteed.

=head2 Accessing Collected Option Values

Assuming the application object is C<$self>, there are a few methods to
get the configurations:

=over

=item * C<config>

   my $value = $self->config('foo');
   my @values = $self->config(@multiple_keys);

get whatever value was computed after collecting values from all sources
and taking the one with the best (i.e. lowest) priority.

=item * C<config_hash>

   my $merged_hash   = $self->config_hash;
   my $complete_hash = $self->config_hash(1);

The first form (or any where the only parameter is considered I<false>
by Perl) gets the I<merged> form, i.e. where each key has one value
associated, based on the priorities set for the sources.

The second form returns a more I<complicated> data structure where the
C<sequence> key points to an array reference containing all details
about data gathering. Explanation of this data structure is beyond the
scope of this manual page.

The second form cam be used in case the provided mechanism of
prioritization is not sufficient.

=item * C<residual_args>

   my @args = $self->residual_args;

Get all arguments from the command line that were not parsed (and hence
I<left> for a sub-command or just unparsed).

=back


=head1 MIXED STUFF

=head2 Managing help as a command-line option

To get C<help> about a command, App::Easer::V2 provides a C<help>
sub-command out of the box I<most of the times>. The exception is for
I<leaf> commands, which do not have sub-commands.

After version C<2.007001> (not included), in addition to the C<help>
command there is also a C<usage> command, which provides the same output
as C<help> but without the C<Description> section. The C<usage>
sub-command is managed as an alias of C<help>; it is possible to remove
this alias by setting C<@App::Easer::V2::Command::Help::aliases> to the
string C<help> alone.

This is not a big deal with hierarchical applications, because it's
possible to invoke the C<help> sub-command of the parent command and
pass the name of the sub-command we need help with:

   # print help about `topcmd`
   $ topcmd help

   # print help about `subcmd` under `topcmd`
   $ topcmd help subcmd

On the other hand, for non-hierarchical applications, the only available
command is also a leaf and this hinders getting a meaningful,
auto-generated help text off the shelf.

In this case, it's possible to include an option for getting help, like
this:

   my $app = {
      options => [
         {
            getopt => 'help|h!',
            help   => 'print help on the command',
         },
         ...

Then, inside the C<execute> sub, it's possible to I<run> the C<help>
sub-command explicitly:

   sub execute ($self) {
      return $self->run_help if $self->config('help');

      # ... normal code for "execute"
      # ...
   }

As of versions after C<2.007001> (not included) it is possible to pass
an additional parameter to C<run_help> with string C<usage>, to get a
shorter help which does not include the C<Description> section.
