Welcome to the site for [App::Easer][] tutorials!

[App::Easer][] is a [Perl][] module to ease making command-line tools,
with special attention to *hierarchical* interfaces (think [Git][] with
all sub-commands).

The module is still a somehow moving target, so tutorials might become
obsolete with time. I hope to update/deprecate them when this happens,
but watch out!

Available tutorials:
